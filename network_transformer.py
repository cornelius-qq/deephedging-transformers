# 4.  Causal Transformer Hedge Network

class TransformerHedgeNet(nn.Module):

    Causal Transformer for deep hedging.

    Takes the full sequence of market features for a batch of paths and returns

    The causal mask inside the attention layers ensures that delta_t depends
    only on features at times 0 ... t — there is no lookahead. This is
    equivalent to running the model autoregressively at inference time, but
    is much more efficient at training time because all timesteps are processed
